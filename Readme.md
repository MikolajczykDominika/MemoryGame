# Program Description
This is a simple memory game written in Java. 
First the user must choose level of game (1- Easy or 2-Hard).
# Why do I code?
A few years ago, I graduated IT studies. 
Later I had a few years of maternity break.
Now I would like to return to professional work related to programming, so I decided to apply to Motorola Java Academy to refresh my knowledge and get job.
